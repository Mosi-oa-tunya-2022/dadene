# Project Outline
#### Our project aims to look at three cryptocurrencies that we believe could rival Bitcoin and Ethereum as long term investments. We all know the cryptocurrency market is all the rage right now but all you really hear about is Bitcoin and Ethereum. We wanted to look at 3 coins we believe could possibly challenge their trends in the future. 
We can't measure Fear and Greed... But we can look at data trends! Cryptocurrency investors should take a price prediction with a good degree of skepticism. One of the major problems with many price predictions about bitcoin is that they lack sufficient analytical support to back up their claims. Some prominent figures in the industry who push for sky-high prices are doing so for reasons that may not be linked to fundamentals.

# Research Questions
1. Are these coins worth investing in?
2. Will they be sustainable or will they die out in the next 5, 10, 15, 30 years?
3. How will they perform against major cryptocoins like Bitcoin and Ethereum?
4. What is the correlation between S&P500 and Bitcoin?

## Datasets 
We implemented the use of Yahoo Finance through pandareader, google finance, alpacas. Panda reader was free and easy to use to pull the data we needed for this project. Google Finance provided us the best data for the S&P500 with easy conversion to csv file. Alpaca was perfect to run monte carlo simulations. Data sources were in json format so they were easy to convert into panda dataframes.
